This is a much simpler version of my homepage, intended to be statically built
from [slweb][slweb] source. It is JavaScript-free.

## Prerequisites

- [Slweb][slweb] and its prerequisites.

- **awk**(1)

## Clone & build

``` 
$ git clone https://github.com/Strahinja/strahinja-org-slw
$ cd strahinja-org-slw
```

Then, if you have [apenwarr/redo][redo]:


```
$ redo
```

and if you don't:

```
$ ./do
```

Website will be built inside the cloned repository. It can be served directly
from that folder.
